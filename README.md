# Text Converter Extension

Text Converter is a browser extension that allows users to convert selected text from English to Arabic and vice versa. The extension also supports copying the converted text to the clipboard.

When the user selects the wrong keyboard language and writes some text and then sees this error, they must erase all the words and then retype them in the correct language. Our add-on solves this problem as it takes the wrong words and converts them to the other language (Arabic to English) or (English to Arab)

## Features

- Convert text from English to Arabic based on keyboard letter mapping.
- Convert text from Arabic to English based on keyboard letter mapping.
- Copy the converted text to the clipboard with a single click.
